            give. They support. They're the person who always says yes. They
            give their time. They give a ride. They lend a shoulder to lean on
            and a ear to listen. Always there for other people's problems.
            Always giving encouragement. Would give the clothes off their back
            and their last dollar. Teach people the proper ways to making money.
            Get them jobs. Forgive debts. Be loyal! And the list goes on... See,
            you don't know how other folks entertain strangers unaware and do
            good deeds for their families and friends. You don't know the good
            hearts of the people who get judged but GOD does and he rewards them
            openly. So, when you see the person beside you prosper just know
            thatâ€™s the RIGHTEOUS GOD!!! To the people who have good hearts and
            you seem to go unnoticed, done wrong, misjudged, used & abused.{" "}
